# The Baum Project

This is a strongly opinionated Angular Application Schematic using NgRx, Angular Flex Layout and Angular Material.

# Getting Started With The Baum Schematic

Create a new angular project without an Application, install the schematic and generate your `Baum App`.

```
ng new my-workspace --createApplication=false
cd my-workspace
ng add angular-mat-baum my-app
ng serve --open=true
```

That's all, enjoy it!
